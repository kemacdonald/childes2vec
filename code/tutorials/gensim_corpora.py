# To convert documents to vectors,  weâ€™ll use a document representation
# called bag-of-words. each document is represented by one vector where
# each vector element represents a key-value pair of the number
# of times that word appears in the document

# represent the questions only by their (integer) ids.
# the mapping between the questions and ids is called a dictionary:
dictionary = corpora.Dictionary(texts)
dictionary.save('/tmp/deerwester.dict') ## tmp storage of dictionary
dictionary.token2id

# convert a new document to a vector representation using doc2bow function
# which simply counts the number of occurrences of each distinct word,
# converts the word to its integer word id and returns the result as a
# bag-of-words--a sparse vector, in the form of [(word_id, word_count), ...].

# let's do it to all of the documents
